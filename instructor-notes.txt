=========================================



Notes:

*Activity*

- Declare a variable and try to access it from a scope where it cannot be accessed (verify that it cannot be accessed).
- Declare a variable ommiting let or const (or var)
- Run some tests on accessibility of that second variable. Accessibility within a block, outside a block, etc.
- 3 min, thumbs up when done, raised hand to volunteer to explain what happens when you ommit let/const


=========================================

*Activity*

- Write a for loop but use var instead of let. Verify: is the variable accessible outside the loop after it has run?
- Verify: is the variable accessible outside of the loop when you use neither var nor let ? (nor const).
- Verify: is the variable accessible outside of the loop with let?
- Verify: What about a let variable defined within the block of the loop?
- 10 minutes, thumbs up when done
